# linearMixedModels
We will write the theory and program to obtain the coefficients of linear mixed models. 

To run the program, you need to run the mixedModel function. The input will be in matrix forms for y values, X values for fixed effect and Z values for random effect. y values are in the long format (all observations are in 1 column).
